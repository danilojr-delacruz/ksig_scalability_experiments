# Run instructions

Two environments are required to run the experiments.
1. KSig
2. SigKerax

There are separate scripts to run the experiments for each file.
ksig_experiments.py and sigkerax_experiments.py

Ensure the appropriate environment is activate when running each file.
Ensure the files are run from the home directory to ensure relative directories are respected.

The results will be stored as pickle files in the results directory.
